LOGIN.PHP VALIDATION ERRORS

Line 12, Column 5: document type does not allow element "DIV" here; missing one of "OBJECT", "MAP", "BUTTON" start-tag
<div>

The mentioned element is not allowed to appear in the context in which you've placed it; the other mentioned elements are the only ones that are both allowed there and can contain the element mentioned. This might mean that you need a containing element, or possibly that you've forgotten to close a previous element.

One possible cause for this message is that you have attempted to put a block-level element (such as "<p>" or "<table>") inside an inline element (such as "<a>", "<span>", or "<font>").
