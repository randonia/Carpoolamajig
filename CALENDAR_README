To add events to a date:
	1) Go into the controllers folder and find and open calendar
	2) In the $data array, add the day you want the event to be on and assign it an array
	3) fill the array with a key/value pair (it should look like key=>value) where key is the event name you want displayed on the calendar and value is the
	   url you want the event to point to
	4) ???
	5) Profit!
